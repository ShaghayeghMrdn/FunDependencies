\section{Contribution}
\label{sec:contribution}

Our work had a fair distribution among the three co authors. 
This being the main reseach project of Ayush Goel, he was primarily 
responsible for setting up the testbed for the experiments and conducting them. 
All the code for the different anaylsis done for the page loads, like network
analysis, trace analysis and capturing the window object state and running
a simple diff algorithm is written by Ayush Goel. He has studied the current 
optimisations in place done by Chrome, and evaluated the improvement in the
loading time with these optimisations enabled. 

Matthew Furlong, the second co author has contributed in finding 
the javascript libraries we currently use to capture the network
and timeline trace for each web page load, on top of which most of 
our other analysis code is written. He has contributed in analysing
data from our experiments by building CDFs of the results and 
comparing them with each other. 

Hyunjong Lee, the third co author has contributed in writing the mid semester
and the final reports, generating figures and writing the content. 

Most importantly, Matthew and Hyunjong were constantly involved in the
critical discussion of the key ideas, and helped in estabilishing the next
steps for our research project.
