\section{Future work}
\label{sec:future-work}

Most of the project up till now, was meant to serve as a motivation for building 
a caching framework for the javascript execution output. All our experiments
have given positive results on the expected benefits of a caching framework. 
We also have established an upper bound on the posible decrease in the page load time
in the best case scenario. 

The actual implementation of the caching framework will be our next step. 
This is more like an engineering effort, which will determine the efficacy
of our idea and will actually evaluate it. 
In order to do this, we will have to modify the production level 
source code of the Chrome browser, as that is the browser we
are focusing on for our research ( the reason for which is mentioned
in the introduction). 

Our understanding of the current caching framework used for compiler
and parser cache can be used as a reference of our javascript caching
framework.
