\section{Future work}
\label{sec:future-work}

Most of the project up till now has been to serve as a motivation for building 
a caching framework for the Javascript execution output. All of our experiments
have shown the positive benefits of a caching framework. 
We also have established an upper bound on the posible decrease in the page load time
in the best case scenario. 

The actual implementation of the caching framework will be our next step. 
This is more like an engineering effort, which will determine the efficacy
of our idea when we can fully evaluate the sytem. 
In order to do this, we will have to modify the production level 
source code of the Chrome browser. 

Our understanding of the current caching framework for compiler
and parser cache can be used as a reference for our Javascript caching
framework.
